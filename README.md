# Simulation-of-a-scene-modeled-with-hierarchy

The objective of this work was to develop an application that models a helicopter. The helicopter can take off and land vertically (Cursor Up (↑) and Cursor Down (↓) keys) and move in a circular motion, with a radius of no less than 30, around the y axis, walking only forwards in its trajectory (Cursor Left(←) key).
The helicopter will be able to drop cargo (for example in the shape of a box), pressing the SPACE key, which should fall vertically, under the action of gravity. Charges should disappear 5 seconds after being dropped.
